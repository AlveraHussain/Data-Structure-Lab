# 🧵 Linked Lists in C/C++

Welcome to the **Linked List Lab** — a complete guide to understanding and implementing linked lists in C/C++. This repository is designed for students, developers, and interviewees who want to master dynamic data structures and pointer manipulation.

## 📘 What is a Linked List?

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are stored in memory and linked using pointers. Unlike arrays, linked lists allow dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion/deletion.

🧩 Topics Covered
1. 🔗 Singly Linked List
Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.

Operations:

Insertion (at beginning, end, specific position)

Deletion (by value or position)

Traversal

Reversal

struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
};

2. 🔁 Doubly Linked List
Each node contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node.

Allows bidirectional traversal.

Operations:

Insertion and deletion at both ends

Reversal

Efficient backward traversal

struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* prev;
    struct Node* next;
};
3. 🔄 Circular Linked List
The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.

Can be singly or doubly circular.

Operations:

Insertion and deletion

Circular traversal
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next; // Points to head if it's the last node
};
4. 🧠 Memory Management with Pointers
Linked lists rely heavily on pointers and dynamic memory allocation.

Use malloc() and free() to manage memory.

Avoid memory leaks by freeing unused nodes.

5. 🧪 Sample Code Snippet
c
// Insert at beginning in singly linked list
void insertAtBeginning(int value) {
    struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    newNode->data = value;
    newNode->next = head;
    head = newNode;
}
