## 📘 Data Structure Lab (C++)

Welcome to **Data Structure Lab**  a focused C++ repository where I explore essential low-level programming concepts that serve as the backbone of efficient data structures and memory management in C++.

### 🧭 Key Focus Areas

* 🧠 **Pointers**
* 🧩 **Function Pointers**
* 💾 **Dynamic Memory Allocation**

These tools are fundamental to implementing core data structures and understanding how memory works under the hood in C++.

## 🔍 What’s Inside

This repository walks through C++ features that closely interact with:

* **Pointer arithmetic and dereferencing**
* **Manual vs. modern memory management**

---

### ✅ Function Pointers

* Storing functions as first-class entities
* Using function pointers for callback mechanisms

### ✅ Dynamic Memory Allocation

* Using `new` / `delete` for manual memory management
* Managing arrays dynamically
* A peek into smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`) in modern C++

## 🚀 What's Next?

Let me know if you'd like help with:

* 📷 Including **example outputs** or **terminal screenshots**
* ⚙️ Setting up a **CMake configuration** for multi-file projects
* 🌐 Converting this into a **GitHub Pages-friendly format** (e.g., Markdown-to-HTML)
