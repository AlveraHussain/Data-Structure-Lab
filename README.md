# 🧠 Data Structures Lab in C/C++

Welcome to the **Data Structures Lab** a hands-on repository designed to help you master the building blocks of efficient programming. This lab includes clean, well-commented implementations of essential data structures using **C/C++**, with a strong focus on understanding memory through **pointers**.

## 📘 Topics 

This lab covers the following core data structures and concepts:

- 🔗 Pointers
- 🧵 Linked Lists
- 🌳 Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs)
- 🚦 Queues (Linear and Circular)

Each module includes:

- ✅ Source code with comments
- 🧪 Sample input/output
- 📊 Diagrams and memory illustrations
- 🧠 Conceptual explanations
